    <p class="main_content">The Milky Way galaxy is the spiral galaxy we call home, as do roughly 100 billion other stars. it looks very much like other spiral galaxies when viewed from above. there are spiral arms and a abright central part. The Sun is far from the center of the Galaxy, halfway to the edge of the Galaxy along the orion spiral arm.</p>
    <p class="main_content">The Sun is revolving around the center of the galaxy at a speed of half a million miles per hour, yet it will still take 200 million years for it to go around once. Do you feel like you are moving at that speed through space? If you did, you would certainly need a seat belt! When we run, we feel the wind on our bodies because there are molecules which make up the air that push against our bodies. But there are very few molecules in the space between the stars. So there is nothing to push against our planet so that we &quot;feel&quot; like we are rushing around half a million miles per hour.</p></td>
